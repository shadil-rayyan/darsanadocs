# Scholarship Application Workflow Documentation

This document outlines the workflow for students applying for scholarships and the administrative process for handling these applications.

## Workflow for Scholarship Students

### Step 1: Accessing Scholarship Information
1. **Visit the Scholarship Portal**: Students visit the designated scholarship portal to read about the available scholarships.
2. **Review Eligibility Criteria and Guidelines**: Students must carefully read the eligibility criteria, application guidelines, and other relevant information provided on the rated pages.

### Step 2: Applying for the Scholarship
1. **Fill Out the Application Form**: 
   - Students proceed to the application section.
   - They fill in the required details and upload necessary documents (e.g., transcripts, recommendation letters, personal statements).
2. **Submit the Application**: Once the form is complete, students submit their application through the portal.

### Step 3: Checking Application Status
1. **Access the Status Page**:
   - Students can check the status of their application by visiting the status page on the portal.
   - The status may be one of the following: *Pending*, *Selected*, *Rejected*, or *Reverted*.
   
2. **Receive Status Notifications**:
   - If the status changes to *Reverted*, the system will automatically send an email to the student's registered email address.
   - The email will contain details about why the application was reverted and instructions on how to proceed.

### Step 4: Responding to Reverted Applications
1. **Review Reversion Details**:
   - Students should carefully review the email received, which will include all necessary information and instructions for addressing the issues raised.
   
2. **Reply to the Reversion Email**:
   - Students need to respond to the email with the required changes or additional information.
   - The application will then be reconsidered by the administrative team.

### Step 5: Final Notification
1. **Final Decision**:
   - Students will receive an email notification about the final decisionâ€”whether they have been *Selected* or *Rejected*.
   - This email will include further instructions if they are selected, or reasons if rejected.

## Workflow for Administrators

### Step 1: Reviewing Applications
1. **Access the Application Portal**:
   - Administrators log in to the administrative section of the scholarship portal to view and manage student applications.
   
2. **Select an Application**:
   - Administrators can browse through submitted applications and select individual applications for review.

### Step 2: Changing Application Status
1. **Update Application Status**:
   - After reviewing the application, administrators can update the status to one of the following:
     - **Selected**: The student has been awarded the scholarship.
     - **Rejected**: The student's application has not been successful.
     - **Reverted**: The application requires further information or correction from the student.
   - Administrators can enter remarks to provide additional context for the status update.

### Step 3: Handling Reverted Applications
1. **Review Student Responses**:
   - After a student replies to a reverted application email, the administrator receives the updated information.
   - The administrator can review the student's response and make any necessary changes to the application.

2. **Final Decision and Further Actions**:
   - The administrator can either revert the status back to the student for further action, update the application based on the new information, or finalize the application by setting it to *Selected* or *Rejected*.

### Step 4: Editing Applications
1. **Edit Application Details**:
   - If needed, administrators have the capability to edit application details directly within the portal.
   - This may involve updating documents, correcting information, or modifying remarks.

### Step 5: Finalizing and Communicating Decisions
1. **Send Final Notifications**:
   - Once the decision is final, administrators ensure that the appropriate email notification is sent to the student, informing them of the outcome.

2. **Document and Archive**:
   - Administrators may also document any final remarks and archive the application for record-keeping purposes.

## Summary
This workflow ensures a streamlined and transparent process for both students and administrators involved in the scholarship application process. Students have a clear path from application to final decision, while administrators have the tools necessary to efficiently manage and communicate decisions regarding scholarship applications.
