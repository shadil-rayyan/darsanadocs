# How We Work

As college students, we balance our academic responsibilities with project development. Our working hours adapt to our schedule, with more intensive collaboration during holidays.

## Night Collaboration (7 PM Onwards)

During regular college days, our primary work sessions start at 7 PM. After completing our academic tasks, we gather on **Google Meet** to collaborate on the project. These evening sessions are dedicated to:

- Reviewing the day's progress and addressing any challenges.
- Collaborating on coding, design, and problem-solving.
- Conducting code reviews and ensuring code quality.
- Planning and assigning tasks for the next day.

## Holiday Work Sessions

On holidays, we maximize our available time by scheduling two key work sessions:

### Afternoon Google Meet

During holidays, we hold an afternoon Google Meet session where we:

- Sync up on the morning's progress and set the agenda for the day.
- Discuss and assign tasks that need to be completed by the evening.
- Address any issues or blockers that have arisen.

### Night Google Meet (7 PM Onwards)

In the evening, starting at 7 PM, we reconvene for another Google Meet session to:

- Review the day's progress and any work completed since the afternoon session.
- Collaborate on remaining tasks, ensuring everything is on track.
- Plan for the next day's work, assigning tasks as needed.

## Tools We Use

- **Google Meet**: For daily check-ins and collaboration sessions.
- **GitHub**: For version control, issue tracking, and code collaboration.
- **Jira**: To manage tasks and track progress across the team.
- **WhatsApp**: For quick communication throughout the day.

This schedule allows us to make significant progress during holidays, ensuring that we stay on track with our project goals while maintaining strong team collaboration.
