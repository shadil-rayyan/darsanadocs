# Product, Gallery, and Conversation Program Workflow Documentation

This document outlines the workflow for managing products, galleries, and conversation programs on the website. The workflow is divided into two main sections: actions available to the admin and the visibility for regular users (clients).

## Workflow for Administrators

### Step 1: Accessing the Admin Dashboard
1. **Log In to the Admin Dashboard**:
   - The administrator logs into the website's admin dashboard using their credentials.

### Step 2: Managing Content Sections
The admin dashboard is organized into different sections for products, galleries, and conversation programs. Each section allows the admin to perform various actions:

#### **A. Managing Products**
1. **Access the Products Section**:
   - Navigate to the "Products" section from the admin dashboard.
   - Here, the admin can view all products currently listed on the website.

2. **Viewing Product Listings**:
   - The admin can see a list of all products, similar to what clients see on the website.
   - Each product entry includes details such as name, description, price, and availability status.

3. **Adding a New Product**:
   - The admin can click the "Add New Product" button to create a new product listing.
   - They can enter all required details (e.g., name, description, price, images) and set the visibility status (public or hidden).

4. **Editing an Existing Product**:
   - The admin can select any product from the list to edit its details.
   - Changes can include updating descriptions, pricing, images, or availability status.

5. **Deleting a Product**:
   - If a product is no longer relevant or needed, the admin can delete it from the list.
   - Deleting a product will remove it entirely from both the admin and client views.

6. **Hiding a Product**:
   - The admin can choose to hide a product from the client-side view without deleting it.
   - This allows for temporary removal from public view while keeping the product in the system for potential future use.

#### **B. Managing the Gallery**
1. **Access the Gallery Section**:
   - Navigate to the "Gallery" section from the admin dashboard.
   - The gallery section displays all images and multimedia content currently featured on the website.

2. **Viewing Gallery Listings**:
   - Similar to the client view, the admin can see all images and multimedia items currently in the gallery.

3. **Adding New Gallery Items**:
   - The admin can upload new images or multimedia files by clicking the "Add New Item" button.
   - They can set the title, description, and visibility status for each item.

4. **Editing Existing Gallery Items**:
   - The admin can select an item from the gallery to edit its details.
   - Changes might include updating the image, title, or description.

5. **Deleting a Gallery Item**:
   - If an image or multimedia item is no longer needed, the admin can delete it from the gallery.
   - This action permanently removes the item from both the admin and client views.

6. **Hiding a Gallery Item**:
   - The admin can hide a gallery item from the client-side view while retaining it in the system for future use.

#### **C. Managing Conversation Programs**
1. **Access the Conversation Programs Section**:
   - Navigate to the "Conversation Programs" section from the admin dashboard.
   - Here, the admin can manage all conversation programs listed on the website.

2. **Viewing Conversation Program Listings**:
   - The admin can see a list of all conversation programs, including details such as title, description, date, and participant information.

3. **Adding a New Conversation Program**:
   - The admin can click the "Add New Program" button to create a new conversation program.
   - They can enter details like the title, description, schedule, and participant information.

4. **Editing an Existing Conversation Program**:
   - The admin can select any program to edit its details, such as updating the schedule, modifying participant information, or changing the description.

5. **Deleting a Conversation Program**:
   - If a program is completed or no longer relevant, the admin can delete it.
   - Deleting a program removes it from both the admin and client views.

6. **Hiding a Conversation Program**:
   - The admin can hide a conversation program from the client view, making it invisible to users while keeping it in the system.

### Step 3: Finalizing Changes
1. **Save and Publish**:
   - After making changes (adding, editing, deleting, or hiding items), the admin must save their changes.
   - For visibility changes, the admin can choose whether to publish the content immediately or schedule it for later.

2. **Review**:
   - The admin can review the entire list of products, gallery items, or conversation programs to ensure everything is correctly set up and visible as intended.

## Workflow for Regular Users (Clients)

### Viewing Products, Gallery, and Conversation Programs
1. **Accessing the Website**:
   - Clients visit the website to browse products, gallery items, and conversation programs.

2. **Viewing Available Content**:
   - Clients can see all products, gallery items, and conversation programs that are publicly available.
   - Hidden items are not visible to clients.

### Interacting with Content
1. **Product Interaction**:
   - Clients can view product details, add items to their cart, and proceed with purchases.

2. **Gallery Interaction**:
   - Clients can browse through the gallery, viewing images and multimedia content.

3. **Conversation Program Interaction**:
   - Clients can view details about conversation programs, register for upcoming sessions, and engage with content related to these programs.

## Summary
This workflow provides a comprehensive guide for administrators to manage the products, gallery, and conversation programs on the website. It ensures that administrators have full control over the content, allowing them to edit, delete, or hide items as needed. Regular users, on the other hand, have access only to the content that is made publicly available, ensuring a clean and well-organized experience on the website.
