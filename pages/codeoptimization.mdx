# Coding Optimization Process

## 1. Initial Development
- **UI Implementation**: 
  - Focus on getting the UI working. 
  - Write the core UI code to ensure the application is functional.

- **Initial Testing**: 
  - Write unit tests for the implemented UI.
  - Verify that the functionality meets expectations.
  - Use this as the baseline for future changes.

## 2. Optimization Process
- **Code Refactoring**:
  - **Splitting and Isolating Code**:
    - Identify parts of the code that can be split into smaller, more manageable components.
    - Isolate reusable logic into separate functions or modules.
    - Enhance code readability and maintainability.

  - **Performance Enhancements**:
    - Implement Skeleton UI and Lazy Loading.
    - Improve SEO performance and reduce initial load times.

- **Breaking and Fixing**:
  - During the optimization process, changes might introduce new issues.
  - Intentionally try to "break" the code by making aggressive optimizations or refactoring.
  - Expose potential weaknesses or dependencies.

## 3. Re-Testing
- **Running Tests**:
  - Re-run the unit tests after making changes.
  - Ensure that the optimizations have not introduced any bugs or regressions.
  - Confirm that the application still functions correctly after optimization.

- **Iterative Process**:
  - Continue to optimize and retest until an optimal balance between performance and functionality is achieved.

## 4. Final Review
- **Final Code Review**:
  - Conduct a final code review to ensure the code is clean, maintainable, and meets all performance benchmarks.

- **Deployment**:
  - Once all tests and reviews are passed, the optimized code is ready for deployment.
