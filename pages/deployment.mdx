# Deployment Process Documentation

## Overview

Our deployment process is designed to ensure smooth and reliable releases of our software. It includes a series of automated steps, testing phases, and monitoring tools to maintain high-quality standards throughout the lifecycle of our application.

## CI/CD Pipeline

We utilize a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process. This pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions, which allows for efficient and consistent deployment from code commits to production.

### GitHub Actions

- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions automatically build the project upon each code commit.
- **Testing**: Integration and end-to-end tests are executed to verify code quality.
- **Deployment**: Once tests pass, code is automatically deployed to the staging environment.

## Environments

### Staging Environment

- **Purpose**: The staging environment is used for final testing before deploying to production.
- **Testing**: Perform thorough testing to ensure the application behaves as expected.
- **Tools**: Utilize end-to-end testing with Playwright and performance assessments using Lighthouse.

### Production Environment

- **Hosting**: The final version of the application is deployed to Vercel or another hosting service.
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment to production is managed through our CI/CD pipeline.

## Testing

### End-to-End Testing

- **Playwright**: We use Playwright for comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure functionality across different scenarios.
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility assessments are carried out using Lighthouse.

### Static Code Analysis

- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security issues are analyzed using SonarQube.
- **GitHub Code Scanning**: Integrated with GitHub for continuous code scanning.

## Monitoring

### Tools

- **Sentry**: Used for error tracking and monitoring application health.
- **Prometheus**: (Optional) For advanced monitoring and alerting. Prometheus can be integrated for detailed metrics and system performance tracking.

### Monitoring Tasks

- **Error Tracking**: Monitor and manage errors to maintain application reliability.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track application performance and resource usage to identify and address potential issues.

## Deployment Automation

- **Vercel**: Automate deployment to Vercel for streamlined updates and hosting.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Changes are automatically deployed following successful testing.

## Summary

Our deployment process integrates modern tools and practices to ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested, automatically deployed, and monitored for errors. By leveraging GitHub Actions, Playwright, Lighthouse, SonarQube, Sentry, and Vercel, we maintain a robust and efficient deployment pipeline.
Monitoring Tasks
Error Tracking:

Sentry: Excellent for tracking and managing errors and exceptions in your application. Provides detailed reports on issues, including stack traces and affected users, and integrates well with various platforms.
Performance Metrics:

Prometheus: Ideal for advanced performance monitoring and alerting. Prometheus collects and stores metrics data, enabling you to create detailed dashboards and set up alerts based on performance thresholds.
Grafana: Often used alongside Prometheus for visualizing performance metrics through customizable dashboards.
New Relic: Provides comprehensive performance monitoring and real-time analytics for application performance and resource usage.
