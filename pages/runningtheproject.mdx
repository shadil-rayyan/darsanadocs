# Running the Project

# Project Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides instructions on how to set up, build, and run the project using Git, npm, and Docker. The testing section has been removed as per the latest update.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git**: Version control system.
- **Node.js and npm**: Node.js runtime and npm package manager.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the project repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your repository.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm.

```bash
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

This command installs all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Build the Project
After installing the dependencies, you need to build the project.

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the project, preparing it for production.

## Running the Project

### 4. Running with Docker
The project can be containerized and run using Docker.

#### a. Docker Standalone
To run the project using Docker, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
docker run -p 3000:3000 <your-image-name>
```

Replace `<your-image-name>` with the desired name for your Docker image. This will build the Docker image and run it, mapping the container’s port 3000 to your machine’s port 3000.

#### b. Docker Compose
Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to run the project. This is useful if your project consists of multiple services.

To do this, ensure you have a `docker-compose.yml` file configured for the project. Then, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build and start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to set up, build, and run the project. If you encounter any issues or have additional questions, please refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
