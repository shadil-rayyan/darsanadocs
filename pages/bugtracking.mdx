# Bug Tracking Process

## Overview

Our bug tracking process is designed to efficiently manage and resolve issues within our software. We use Jira for reporting, triaging, and resolving bugs, while integrating with GitHub Issues and Trello for additional workflow management and communication.

## Bug Tracking Workflow

### 1. Reporting

- **Platform**: Jira
- **Process**: Team members report bugs by creating issues in Jira.
- **Details**: Ensure each bug report includes:
  - **Title**: A clear and concise title.
  - **Description**: A detailed description of the issue.
  - **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions to replicate the issue.
  - **Expected vs. Actual Results**: What was expected versus what actually occurred.
  - **Screenshots/Logs**: Attach relevant screenshots or logs if available.

### 2. Triaging

- **Platform**: Jira
- **Process**: Bugs are reviewed and prioritized based on:
  - **Severity**: Impact on the application and users.
  - **Frequency**: How often the bug occurs.
  - **Priority**: Business or development priorities.
- **Actions**: Assign severity levels and categorize bugs to streamline the resolution process.

### 3. Resolution

- **Platform**: Jira
- **Process**:
  - **Assignment**: Bugs are assigned to appropriate team members for resolution.
  - **Fixing**: Developers work on fixing the bug according to the assigned priority.
  - **Status Updates**: Regularly update the issue status in Jira to reflect progress.

### 4. Verification

- **Platform**: Jira
- **Process**:
  - **Testing**: Once a bug fix is complete, it is transitioned into the testing workflow.
  - **Verification**: The QA team tests the fix to ensure the issue is resolved.
  - **Status Change**: If the fix is verified, the bug status is updated to "Resolved" or "Closed."


## Summary

Our bug tracking process ensures that issues are reported, prioritized, resolved, and verified efficiently. By leveraging Jira for detailed issue management and integrating with GitHub Issues and Trello, we maintain a streamlined and effective bug tracking system.
